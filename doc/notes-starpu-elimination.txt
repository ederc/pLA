Notes on the tiled Gaussian Elimination with StarPU
====================================================

1.  In order to realize fitting tile size (i.e. square ones) we have to adjust
    the matrix size with respect to the user-given tile size. For any matrix
    of dimensions l x m we have to add tile_size - (tile_size % l) rows and
    tile_size - (tile_size % m) columns.
    Note that since we have not implemented pivoting as of now we have to fill
    these additional entries with random numbers and not with zeros!

2.  Working over fields with prime characteristic <2^16 and matrix entries of
    size 2^64 we can delay the modulus operation: Assume a,b,c < 2^16 and an
    update of a by b*c during the Gaussian Elimination: a <- a + b*c. Since
    b*c < 2^32 we can do up to 2^31 of these updates:
    a + 2^31 * b*c < 2^16 + 2^31*2^32 < 2^64.

3.  Due to the tiled structure of the algorithm we can delay the modulus
    operation for the SSSSM step, but not for GETRI, GESSM and TRSTI: GETRI
    computes the final values for elements in block A: above the diagonal we get
    the final elements in the Gaussian Elimination and those below are the
    multipliers in the next steps. GESSM and TRSTI also compute final
    values in block B, resp.
